The Data Pallet
Originally, I ended up with data from a brazillian delivery service company called 'iFoods' that is being handled by Doordash. The datasets hold information about more than 2000 consumers; their income, their total spending pattern on food products like wines, meat, fish, sweets etc. Their purchase preferences based on the features iFoods was offering (such as deals, in-store, catalogue, website etc.) and other demographical information about customers, like age, education qualifications and marital status.
